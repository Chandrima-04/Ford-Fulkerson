# Ford-Fulkerson
• Implement Ford-Fulkerson algorithm using classes Graph and DFS. 
• Imagine that a biological system has n elements of class A and n elements of class B. Some of the elements of class A interact with elements of class B. However, each element cannot interact with more than a single other element at the same time. We believe that biological system reaches equilibrium when maximum number of elements are involved in interaction simultaneously. Using Ford-Fulkerson algorithm ﬁnd the list of interacting elements. On the ﬁrst line of the input there is n followed bu the list of interacting pairs of elements. Each element of a class is assigned a number from 1 to n.
